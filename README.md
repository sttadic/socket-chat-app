# Java Socket Programming - Chat Application
Network Technologies module - Higher Diploma in Software Development <br>
Author: Stjepan Tadic

## Description
This is a console-based chat application written in Java. It demonstrates networking concepts, multithreading, and thread-safe operations. The application uses sockets to establish communication between clients and the server, and Javaâ€™s virtual threads for efficient and concurrent handling of multiple clients. Thread safety is ensured using concurrent collection CopyOnWriteArrayList and atomic boolean flag.

<br>

## Usage
#### Prerequisites: Java 19 or later to support virtual threads.
- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sttadic/socket-chat-app.git
```

- Run the application (compiled):
```bash
java ie.atu.sw.ChatServer                   // The server starts listening on default port 13 
```

```bash
java ie.atu.sw.ChatClient <host> <port>     // Starts the client(s). With no command-line arguments defaults to 'localhost', port 13
                                            // <host> The optional hostname of the server
                                            // <port> The optional port number of the server
```

## Features
> **Chat Room Functionality** <br>
- Multiple clients can join or leave the chat room.
- Messages are broadcasted and clearly displayed to all connected clients except to the sender, containing a name of a sender in uppercase and content of a message.

> **Connection Configuration** <br>
- The client can use command-line arguments to specify hostname and port.
- Defaults to *localhost:13* if no arguments are provided.

> **Graceful Disconnection** <br>
- Clients can leave the chat by typing **\q**.
- The server cleans up resources and notifies other clients when a member leaves.

> **Concurrent Client Handling** <br> 
- Virtual threads are used for efficient and lightweight management of client connections.

> **Comprehensive Error Handling** <br>
- Provides extensive error handling and displays error messages in a user-friendly fashion for scenarios such as failure to connect to the server, binding issues with the server, client disconnecting abruptly either before or after providing a username, issues with unresponsive server, and more.

> **Resource Cleanup:** <br> 
- Each part of application efficiently manages resources such as input/output streams, executor service and socket connections by ensuring they are closed when no longer needed.
